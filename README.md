1.Financial market News Sentiment Analysis 
This project performs sentiment analysis on a financial market news dataset containing the top 25 news headlines per day, predicting whether the overall market sentiment is positive (1) or negative (0). The dataset is loaded using pandas, and exploratory analysis reveals 4101 rows and 27 columns (including a date, sentiment label, and 25 news headlines). The headlines are concatenated for each day to form a single text feature. A bag-of-words model is applied using CountVectorizer to convert the text data into numerical features. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using train_test_split. A RandomForestClassifier with 200 estimators is trained on the data, and the modelâ€™s performance is evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report. The final model achieves an accuracy of 52%, with precision and recall metrics varying between the two sentiment classes.
